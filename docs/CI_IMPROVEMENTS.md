# CI/CD Workflow Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the CI/CD pipeline.

## 🎯 Overview

After systematically resolving ESLint complexity violations across the codebase, we've enhanced the CI/CD workflow to maintain code quality and catch issues early.

## 🚀 Workflow Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Improvements:**

- ✅ **Lint Enforcement**: ESLint runs on every push/PR
- ✅ **Format Checking**: Prettier formatting validation
- ✅ **Type Checking**: Vue TypeScript checking (when applicable)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Quality Checks**: Runs `quality:check` script on PRs
- ✅ **Better Test Coverage**: Improved coverage reporting with Codecov integration
- ✅ **Artifact Management**: Better handling of coverage and build artifacts

**Jobs:**

1. **Quality**: Runs linting, formatting, type checking, and tests
2. **Build**: Creates production build (main branch only)
3. **Deploy**: Deploys to GitHub Pages (main branch only)

### 2. Pull Request Validation (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)

**New comprehensive PR checks:**

- ✅ **Complexity Validation**: Specifically checks for ESLint complexity violations
- ✅ **Coverage Thresholds**: Validates test coverage requirements
- ✅ **Quality Comments**: Automatic PR comments with quality status
- ✅ **Draft Protection**: Only runs on ready-for-review PRs

### 3. Maintenance Workflow (`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`)

**Weekly automated maintenance:**

- ✅ **Security Audit**: npm audit and CodeQL analysis
- ✅ **Dependency Updates**: Check for outdated packages
- ✅ **Quality Monitoring**: Regular quality health checks
- ✅ **TODO/FIXME Tracking**: Scans for technical debt markers

## 🛠️ Local Development Tools

### Quality Check Script (`scripts/quality-check.sh`)

A local script that mirrors the CI pipeline:

```bash
# Run comprehensive local quality checks
npm run quality:local

# Or run individual checks
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format:check  # Check Prettier formatting
npm run format        # Fix formatting
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run quality:check # Combined quality check
```

**Features:**

- 🎨 Colored output for better readability
- 🚀 Fast feedback loop
- 📊 Coverage report generation
- 🏗️ Production build validation

## 📊 Quality Standards Enforced

### Code Complexity

- **Maximum Complexity**: 16 (ESLint complexity rule)
- **Maximum Function Length**: 100 lines
- **Recent Fixes**: Reduced complexity in 3 major functions:
  - `SimulateGamesPage.tableRows`: 40 → <16
  - `GameState.candidatesForSlot`: 23 → <16
  - `GameState.monteCarloSlotProbabilities`: 47 → <16

### Test Coverage

- **Current Coverage**: 97.41%
- **Total Tests**: 265 tests across 15 files
- **Coverage Enforcement**: CI fails if coverage drops significantly

### Code Formatting

- **Tool**: Prettier with consistent configuration
- **Enforcement**: CI blocks PRs with formatting issues
- **Auto-fix**: Available via `npm run format`

## 🔄 Workflow Triggers

### Main CI (`ci.yml`)

- **Push**: Any branch
- **Pull Request**: Any target branch

### PR Checks (`pr-checks.yml`)

- **Pull Request**: opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review
- **Excludes**: Draft PRs

### Maintenance (`maintenance.yml`)

- **Schedule**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Can be triggered via GitHub Actions UI

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Early Issue Detection**: Quality issues caught before merge
2. **Consistent Code Style**: Automated formatting and linting
3. **Complexity Control**: Prevents complex code from entering codebase
4. **Security Monitoring**: Regular security audits
5. **Developer Experience**: Local tools mirror CI environment
6. **Automated Feedback**: PR comments provide immediate quality status

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Before Committing

```bash
# Run full quality check locally
npm run quality:local

# Quick individual checks
npm run lint:fix      # Fix linting issues
npm run format        # Fix formatting
npm run test         # Run tests
```

### For Pull Requests

1. Ensure all local quality checks pass
2. Push your branch
3. Create PR (will trigger comprehensive checks)
4. Address any issues reported in PR comments
5. Merge when all checks pass ✅

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Current Status

- ✅ **0 ESLint Complexity Violations**
- ✅ **265/265 Tests Passing**
- ✅ **97.41% Test Coverage**
- ✅ **All Formatting Issues Resolved**

### Ongoing Monitoring

- Weekly security audits
- Automated dependency update notifications
- Quality trend tracking via artifacts
- Coverage threshold enforcement
