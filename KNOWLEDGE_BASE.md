- **Strategy Engine**: Different AI personalities/strategies
- **Decision Making**: Move calculation and optimization
- **Learning Capabilities**: Analyze game patterns

**Implementation Notes**:

- Create separate AI modules/classes
- Implement strategy pattern for different AI types

### 3. User Interface

**Priority**: High

- **Game Board**: Interactive visual representation
- **Controls**: Move input, game controls
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop support
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use Quasar components for consistent UI
- Implement touch and mouse interactions
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for board layout

### 4. Statistics & Analysis

**Priority**: Medium

- **Game History**: Store and retrieve past games
- **Performance Metrics**: Win/loss ratios, move analysis
- **Strategy Analysis**: Pattern recognition in gameplay
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for insights

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use local storage or IndexedDB for data persistence
- Implement data export/import functionality
- Consider using Chart.js or similar for visualizations

### 5. Unit Testing

**Priority**: High

- **Test Coverage**: 100% for game logic, high for UI components
- **Testing Framework**: To be selected (Jest, Vitest recommended)
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests on every commit

**Implementation Notes**:

- Set up testing framework early in development
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Mock external dependencies

## Game Rules & Mechanics

### Basic Game Concept

**Bomb Busters** is a cooperative deduction game where players are a team of bomb disposal experts trying to defuse a bomb by safely cutting wires.

#### Objective

- The team wins by cutting all safe wires (blue and yellow) without:
  - Cutting a red wire (instant explosion)
  - Letting the detonator dial reach the explosion icon (üíÄ)

#### Players

- Human vs AI, AI vs AI, Human vs Human
- Each player takes a Character card and 1 or 2 tile stands with face-down wire tiles (depending on player count)

#### Components

- Wire tiles: Blue (safe), Yellow (safe but harder to identify), Red (cut = instant explosion!)
- Info tokens, equipment cards, detonator dial

#### Game Setup

1. Pick a mission (missions get harder over time)
2. Choose a Captain (rotates each mission)
3. Distribute Character cards and wire tiles
4. Place info tokens, equipment cards, and the detonator dial

#### Gameplay (Turns in Clockwise Order)

On your turn, choose one of these 3 actions:

1. **Dual Cut**
   - Try to cut a wire from your hand and one from a teammate's hand, of the same value.
   - Guess your teammate‚Äôs wire value.
   - If correct: both wires are revealed and safely cut.
   - If wrong:
     - If red: üí• game over!
     - If blue/yellow: dial advances + info token is placed.

2. **Solo Cut**
   - If all remaining wires of a value are in your own hand, you can cut 2 or 4 identical wires by yourself.
   - Safe only if you're sure of their values.

3. **Reveal Red Wires**
   - If all your remaining wires are red, you can reveal them without cutting.

#### Yellow Wires

- Treated as ‚ÄúYELLOW‚Äù (not by number).
- Cut using the same Dual or Solo method.
- If guessed wrong, the dial still advances.

#### Clues and Info Tokens

- Each player gives one public clue at the start by placing an info token on a wire in their own hand.
- More info tokens are revealed during failed guesses.

#### Equipment

- Becomes usable when 2 wires of its number are cut.
- Can be used once, sometimes even outside your turn.
- Abilities vary (e.g., scanning wires, protecting from errors, etc.).

#### Characters

- Each has a 1-use special ability per mission (e.g., guessing 2 wires at once).

#### Game Over

- You lose if:
  - A red wire is cut.
  - The detonator dial reaches the skull.
- You win if:
  - All safe wires are cut and no wires remain in any player's stand.

#### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: Set up board, mission, and players
2. **Turn Management**: Alternate between players, Captain rotates each mission
3. **Action Selection**: Choose Dual Cut, Solo Cut, or Reveal Red Wires
4. **Move Validation**: Ensure legal moves and apply consequences
5. **Win/Lose Check**: Check for victory or defeat conditions
6. **Result Recording**: Store game statistics

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features

- **Tools System**: Additional game mechanics beyond strings
- **AI Training**: Machine learning for AI improvement

### Technical Improvements

- **TypeScript**: Gradual migration for better type safety
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimize for large-scale gameplay
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
